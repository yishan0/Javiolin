# Javiolin

Javiolin is an educational Java-based game designed to help high school violinists learn and master high positions on the violin fingerboard while improving their sight-reading skills. The game combines note recognition, timing, and interactive feedback to create a fun and effective learning experience.

## Overview

### Goal of the Game
The main goal is to help players grasp a solid understanding of violin notes in higher positions and enhance their ability to sight-read music accurately and quickly.

### Gameplay

- The game features a realistic violin fingerboard divided into sections that glow to represent different notes.
- Notes randomly generate and fall down the fingerboard.
- Players must type the correct note name on their keyboard as the note reaches the glowing section.
- Correct and timely inputs earn points; incorrect or mistimed notes deduct points.
- Each typed note plays the corresponding sound to reinforce audio recognition.
- The game is timed, either by a chosen song or a freeplay mode consisting of rounds customizable between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.

### Teaching & Feedback
- After each round, fingerboard sections glow in colors from green to red, indicating how often each note was played correctly or missed.
- A list of the most missed notes is displayed to help players focus their practice.
- Scores are accompanied by a letter grade from A to F based on accuracy.
